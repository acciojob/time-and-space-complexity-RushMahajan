    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. In other words, it helps us understand how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. An algorithm with a lower time complexity is more efficient as it completes its task in a shorter amount of time.</p>
    
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It helps us analyze how much memory an algorithm requires to execute and how that requirement changes with varying input sizes. Space complexity is often denoted using big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> becomes a crucial consideration when dealing with constrained memory environments or when optimizing the use of system resources.</p>
